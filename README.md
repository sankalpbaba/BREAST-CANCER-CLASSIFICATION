# ADABOOST
AdaBoost algorithm, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a Boosting technique used as an Ensemble Method in Machine Learning. It is called Adaptive Boosting as the weights are re-assigned to each instance, with higher weights assigned to incorrectly classified instances.

# Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM)
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. ... Extreme Gradient Boosting is an efficient open-source implementation of the stochastic gradient boosting ensemble algorithm

# LightGBM
Light GBM is a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithm, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks.

# CatBoost
The CatBoost algorithm is based on Gradient Descent and is a powerful technique for supervised machine learning tasks. It will be well suited to problems that involve categorical data. It is widely used for regression and classification tasks
